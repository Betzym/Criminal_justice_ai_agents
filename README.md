Criminal Justice AI Agents

Overview

This repository showcases a project that integrates AI into the criminal justice system through a multi-agent framework. By utilizing tools like LangChain and CrewAI, the project simulates legal proceedings such as arraignments to provide realistic training environments for legal professionals. The goal is to enhance the education and efficiency of attorneys, judges, and law enforcement officers.

Key Features


Multi-Agent AI Framework: Simulates roles like prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, and judge to model legal proceedings.

LangChain Integration: Leverages LangChain for creating and managing AI agents with specific legal roles.

CrewAI: Utilized to enhance agent interactions and simulations.

Deepfake Demo: Demonstrates the potential of AI-generated simulations in legal training.
